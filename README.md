# docker-template

A minimal and secure [Alpine Linux][alpine] based [Docker][docker] image.

## Configuration

### Host user mapping

Host user and group can be mapped to a container by defining `HOST_UID` and
`HOST_GID` environment variables. If the variables are left undefined the
container will execute its command as `nobody:nobody`.

## Logging

Container is compatible with `docker logs` command although logging is disabled
by default if the container is started with `docker-compose` command. To find
out more about logging see the command [reference][docker-logs].
